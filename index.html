            <p>The <a href="https://www.softcover.io/">Softcover</a>
            publishing platform was designed mainly for ebooks like some popular
            IT textbooks but it's also good for making more traditional books,
            such as the novel 
            <em>Moby-Dick</em> by Herman Melville (sometimes written as 
            <em>Moby-Dick</em>. We present below a short and affectionately 
            irreverent book report on this classic of American literarte.

                    >Call me Ismael.</span> 
                    
                    Some years ago-never mind how long
                    precisely having little or no money in my purse, and nothing 
                    particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a 
                    little and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of 
                    driving off the spleen and regulating the curculation.
                </p>

                <p>
                    After driving off his spleen (which <em> can't</em>) be good for you,
                    Ismael then goes on in much the same vein for approximately one jillion
                    pages. The only thing bigger than Moby Dick (who<em>spoiler alert!</em>
                    is a giant white whale) is the book itself.
